# Preprocessing sequencing data using Cell Ranger ARC {#intro}

Cell Ranger ARC is a set of analysis pipelines that process Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression sequencing data to generate a variety of analyses pertaining to gene expression (GEX), chromatin accessibility, and their linkage. The pipeline includes base calling, sample demultiplexing, mapping, peak calling and read counting. You can refer to the complete instructions from 10x Genomics [here](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger-arc/latest/analysis/running-pipelines/single-library-analysis).

> Note that the Cell Ranger ARC pipeline can only analyze Gene Expression and ATAC data together. It must not be used to analyze Gene Expression or ATAC alone. If scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq are generated from separate experiments, you should process them separately-- using [Cell Ranger](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest) for processing scRNA-seq and [Cell Ranger ATAC](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/overview/welcome) for processing scATAC-seq.
