This dataset is collected from a 25-year-old healthy female donor with around 10,000 cells, and scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq profiles were simultaneously sequenced from the same cells. You can find all information about this data and Cell Ranger ARC output reports from 10x Genomics website. For the purposes of this vignette, we treat the datasets as originating from two different experiments and integrate them together. Since they were originally measured in the same cells, this provides a ground truth that we can use to assess the accuracy of integration. We emphasize that our use of the multiome dataset here is for demonstration and evaluation purposes, and that users should apply these methods to scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets that are collected separately. This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/.
