This dataset is collected from a 25-year-old healthy female donor with around 10,000 cells, and scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq profiles were simultaneously sequenced from the same cells. You can find all information about this data and Cell Ranger ARC output reports from 10x Genomics website. In this hands-on tutorial, we present a complete workflow for analyzing multiome data, with an additional section for data integration of multiomics. We will demonstrate how to preprocess raw sequencing data using Cell Ranger, perform data quality control, clustering and cell type annotation, and identify marker genes using differential expression (DE) analysis. Then we will treat the two profiles of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq as originating from two separate experiments, and perform data integration. Since they were originally measured in the same cells, this provides a ground truth that we can use to assess the accuracy of integration. This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #.
